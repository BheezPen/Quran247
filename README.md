# Quran247

## About The Project

Quran247 is an automated Python project designed to generate visually appealing JPEG/PNG images of random Quranic verses. The primary goal is to facilitate daily reminders and reflections by creating shareable content for social media platforms like Instagram. Future enhancements aim to include the Tafsir (exegesis) of the chosen verse, providing deeper understanding alongside the verse itself.


## Sample Output

Here are a few examples of the JPEG images generated by Quran247:

| Sample 1 | Sample 2 |
| :-------------------------: | :-------------------------: |
| ![Sample Quran Verse Image 1](generated_images/img_for_053011013.png) | ![Sample Quran Verse Image 2](generated_images/img_for_053011013.png) |

| Sample 3 | Sample 4 |

## Features

* **Random Verse Generation:** Automatically selects a random Quranic verse.
* **Image Overlay:** Renders the selected verse onto a customizable background image.
* **Social Media Ready Output:** Generates images optimized for sharing on platforms like Instagram.
* **Verse Identification:** Includes the Surah name and verse number for context (e.g., "QURAN 29: AL-ANKABUT (THE SPIDER), VERSE 61").
* **Automated Generation:** Designed for potential scheduling and automated posting.
* **[Planned] Tafsir Inclusion:** Future development will integrate Tafsir for a comprehensive understanding of each verse.
* **[Planned] Customizable fonts, background images, etc.**

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x (Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bheezpen/Quran247.git
    
    cd Quran247
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. This isolates the project's dependencies from your system-wide Python packages.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Project Dependencies:**
    Once your virtual environment is activated, install the required packages using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If you need to update the `requirements.txt` later, first activate your virtual environment, then run:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Run the main script:**
    After setting up and installing dependencies, you can run the project:

    ```bash
    python mainfile.py
    ```

## Project Structure

* `font/`: Contains font files used for rendering text on images.
* `generated_images/`: Where the generated JPEG images are saved.
* `QuranArabic.txt`: Contains Arabic Quranic verses.
* `en_transliteration.txt`: Contains English transliterations of Quranic verses.
* `quran_chapters_surah.txt`:  Contains information about Quranic chapters/surahs.
